# ecommerce-link-utils

## SUMMARY
This is a crude utility I've built to easily generate links to e-commerce listings using just the listing IDs.  However as the name of the project implies, I may implement other tools over time including incorporating features from my other projects.

## INSTRUCTIONS
This is built entirely for the front end, so you can either browse to the deployed page or download this repository and open in your browser locally.

When you enter the listing's ID in the form and click on the appropriate e-commerce website button, a link to that listing will be generated.

## LIVE VIEW
